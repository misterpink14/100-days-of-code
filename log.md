# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 0: December 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**

Got back into dev auto config project.
+ Scrapped plan to convert it to go
+ Created "templates"
+ Fixed neovim and homebrew install/update

**Thoughts:** 

I'm spending too much time trying to plan ahead and design. I just need to get it done and refactor.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
