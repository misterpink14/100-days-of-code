# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 0: December 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**

Got back into dev auto config project.
+ Scrapped plan to convert it to go
+ Created "templates"
+ Fixed neovim and homebrew install/update

**Thoughts:** 

I'm spending too much time trying to plan ahead and design. I just need to get it done and refactor.
