# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 0: December 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**

Got back into dev auto config project.
+ Scrapped plan to convert it to go
+ Created "templates"
+ Fixed neovim and homebrew install/update

**Thoughts:** 

I'm spending too much time trying to plan ahead and design. I just need to get it done and refactor.

### Day 2: December 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**

Refactored and simplified the project so that adding the remaining features will be easier. Finished bash\_profile copying and added (untested) brew dependencies.

Remaining work: 
+ missing neovim plugin dependencies (rethink how to organize this in config)
+ iterm preferences
+ ssh forwarding script
+ merging bash\_profiles from my machines
+ determine futher features

**Thoughts:** 

Think more, hack less
